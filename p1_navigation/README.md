# Project 1: Navigation

![Trained agent](./trained_banana_agent.gif)

### Introduction

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Following the [setup](../README.md) steps to setup your conda environment.

2. Download the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

3. Place the file in the `p1_navigation/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

4. Run the [Jupyter notebook](./Navigation.ipynb).

### (TODO) Challenge: Learning from Pixels

In this challenge, the agent learned directly from pixels!

1. The environment for the challenge is almost identical to the previous one, where the only difference is 
that the state is an 84 x 84 RGB image, corresponding to the agent's first-person view. Download the new 
environment that matches your operating system:
